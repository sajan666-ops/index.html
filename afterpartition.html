<h3 style=" color: #244768;"> üåè Faridkot After Partition (Post-1947)
After India gained independence and the Punjab region was divided in 1947, Faridkot became a part of the Indian Union, eventually being integrated into the modern state of Punjab. The geographical identity of Faridkot remained similar in terms of physical features ‚Äî it still lies in the southwestern part of Punjab ‚Äî but its administrative and infrastructural landscape changed drastically. The partition caused a major demographic shift, with many Muslims migrating to Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs from western Punjab (now in Pakistan) resettling in Faridkot and surrounding areas.

Faridkot now lies between latitudes 30.67¬∞N and longitudes 74.75¬∞E, covering an area of about 1,458 square kilometers. It is bounded by Firozpur in the north, Moga to the east, Bathinda to the south, and Muktsar to the west. The region forms part of the alluvial plains of Punjab, with generally flat terrain and fertile soil enriched by the Indira Gandhi Canal system and other modern irrigation projects. The city has expanded with better roads, railways, and public services, including hospitals, schools, and universities like Baba Farid University of Health Sciences.

Post-partition Faridkot has seen growth in both agricultural productivity and urban infrastructure. It remains a major contributor to Punjab‚Äôs wheat and cotton production. In recent decades, Faridkot has also seen moderate urbanization, with residential colonies, markets, and government institutions spreading beyond the old town center. The city has retained its cultural identity rooted in Sikh and Punjabi traditions, but now with stronger connectivity to national development networks. Environmental concerns such as groundwater depletion and pesticide use in agriculture have become challenges in the modern era.</h3>
