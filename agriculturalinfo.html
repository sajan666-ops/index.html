<center><h1 style="color: #214768;">AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION</h1>
<h3 style="color: #244768"> Faridkot district, in south-western Punjab, has a strong agricultural base with around 82% of its 1,469 sq. km area under cultivation. The soil is predominantly alluvial, ideal for intensive farming, and the district receives an average annual rainfall of 400â€“500 mm, though irrigation is primarily managed through canals and over 26,000 tube wells. In the Rabi season, wheat covers over 1.10 lakh hectares, while in Kharif, paddy spans approximately 95,000 hectares, and cotton covers about 75,000 hectares, making it a major cash crop. The region also produces pulses, vegetables, and fruits like kinnow and guava in smaller quantities. With over 90% of farms mechanized, Faridkot is agriculturally advanced but faces serious challenges like soil nutrient depletion, groundwater over-extraction, and pest issues (e.g., whitefly in cotton). The Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Faridkot and the Punjab Agriculture Department play key roles in promoting sustainable agriculture through training, soil health cards, and subsidy programs.</h3>
