Before the partition of India in 1947, Faridkot was part of the princely state of Faridkot under British India. It was a small but strategically important territory located in the Punjab region, governed by local rulers who maintained semi-autonomy under British suzerainty. Geographically, the region lay between the Sutlej and Beas rivers, with fertile plains that supported agriculture, mainly wheat, barley, and cotton. The land was flat and well-irrigated by traditional canal systems and seasonal rains, making it suitable for farming and livestock.

Faridkot was surrounded by other princely states and British-administered areas of Punjab, and it shared cultural and economic ties with nearby towns like Firozpur, Bathinda, and Muktsar. The city and its surrounding areas had a mixed population comprising Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims, living together in a shared cultural space. Its position on trade routes and proximity to important towns gave it both strategic and economic significance. Infrastructure was limited but functional, with dirt roads, small markets, and a few administrative buildings centered around the Faridkot Fort and the royal palace.

Topographically, Faridkot before partition had very limited industrial development, and the economy revolved almost entirely around agriculture and handicrafts. The area also included thick groves of kikar and neem trees, and seasonal ponds that supported biodiversity. Natural drainage from monsoon rains would flow into local ponds or rivers, and environmental management was largely traditional. The city had a rural character, with mud houses and open fields stretching far beyond the town limits.</h3>
